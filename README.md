# Summary

A Universal Dependencies corpus for Zaar (aka Sayanci), a member of the Chadic branch of the Afro-Asiatic phylum. The language is mainly spoken by about 200,000 speakers in the Bogoro and Tafawa Balewa local governments of Bauchi State, Nigeria.

# Introduction

The treebank is manually annotated in [SUD_Zaar-Autogramm](https://github.com/surfacesyntacticud/SUD_Zaar-Autogramm). 
The data was extracted from Bernard Caron's corpus in Elan format (https://corpafroas.huma-num.fr/Archives/corpus.php).

Sentences are annotated with the following metadata:

 - `sent_id` (which indicates the source file and the segmentation identifier in the source file)
 - `speaker_id` (which identifies the turn of speech)
 - `sound_url` (which enables playback of the audio recording)
 - `seá¹…t_timecode` (which enables playback of the sentence)
 - `text` (lexical tokenization)
 - `text_ortho` (original transcription of the audio recording)
 - `text_en` (English interpretation)
  

# Structure

This version of the treebank is a dependency parsing of the original corpus first three files. 

The original data are spoken data, which were originally segmented in interpausal units, and interlinearized, translated and glossed in Elan. For the syntactic treebank, a re-alignment was done using the illocutionary unit as a sentence. Tokens comprize words and affixes (preceded by a "=" sign) when those bear a syntactic function. Punctuation tokens (e.g. <, >, //, etc.) organise the illocutionary unit into: pre-nucleus < nucleus > post-nucleus //.

The UD Zaar treebank counts 8441 tokens for 817 sentences.
